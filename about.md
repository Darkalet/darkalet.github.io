Hi! I'm Daniel, and I'm a GIS Analyst/Cartographer/Geo-everything-lover.

![avatar](/static/img/avatar.png){:class="img-responsive"}

After completing a Geography Degree at [University of Valencia], I started to gain interest in cartography and everything related to GIS. I took [UNIGIS] Professional Master in Geographical Information Systems, and specialized in Geospatial Analysis. To complete even more my knowledge and skills I’ve done several courses, like Environmental Education and Environmental Impact Analysis.

I’ve been working in local government councilors, doing a wide variety of tasks related to environment and agriculture;  from redacting  technical reports to develop environmental education programs.

On the GIS side, I have been employed by companies to do all kinds of *geothings* :

Spatial analysis
Cartographic production
Database maintenance
...and so on 

I work with a wide range of gis-related tools, with special emphasis in open source software.

In my free time I like to contribute my grain of salt to the [OpenStreetMap] initiative, and his [Humanitarian OSM Team].
