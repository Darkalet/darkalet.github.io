Hi! I'm Daniel, and I'm a GIS Analyst. After completing a Geography Degree at [University of Valencia], I started to gain interest in cartography and everything related to GIS. I took [UNIGIS] Professional Master in Geographical Information Systems, and specialized in Geospatial Analysis. To complete even more my knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve done several courses, like Environmental Education and Environmental Impact Analysis.

I work with a wide range of gis-related tools, with special emphasis  in open source software.
