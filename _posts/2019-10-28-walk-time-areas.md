The first map i dare to upload here its gonna be about Murcia, the city i currently live now. Throught the days I've spent walking in its streets i've been observing the amount of people who uses a private car for relatively short distances, that in most cases a short walk would be more time saving, given the amount of time needed to find a parking spot (which the city center lacks).

With that in mind, i did an easy map in QGIS, using the [Open Route Service] complement, that uses [Open-Street-Map] data to calculate time and distance isochrones. The center of the map is Murcia's most known roundabout, Plaza Circular, mostly used as an appointment place.
