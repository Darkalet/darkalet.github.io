Minimalistic maps have always a soft spot in my heart. In the last weeks I’ve been watching a lot of simple, yet useful and informative minimalistic maps. Though the most of the them only displays  streets and blocks of the most iconic cities in a monochromatic style, I found the works of [Robert Szucs], which i felt immediately in love. His maps are a great example of minimalism and scientific accuracy at the same time. And plenty of vibrant colors!

Inspired by him, I tried to mess around with a dataset of the [Segura Hydrographic Confederation], and make a map as simple as possible, displaying the cardinal direction of each individual line through colours.

In order to make this, I used this little formula in the field calculator to transform the cartographical azimuthal result automatically in degrees:

Using this degrees I made a new field, that displays each line cardinal or intercardinal direction, pre-establishing different degrees ranges. 

At this point I had a tiny little problem, the fact that QGIS doesn’t include a cyclic colour ramp generator. Cyclic colour maps have colours that match at each end, perfect for this case. Luckily [Peter Kovesi website] (Member of the Geophysics & Image Analysis Group at Western Australia University) includes a great download section with colour maps (including cyclic colour maps) designed to have uniform perceptual contrast over in their whole range for a wide variety of software, includying QGIS :)

With a new QGIS style in my power (yes!) I finished my map. I could have worked the cardinal direction rose a bit more, but I wanted it to be as simplistic as possible. And I think I achieved that!



Kudos to Peter Kovesi :D
